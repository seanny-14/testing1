            <br>After the series of typhoons with serious earthquakes thrown in to the mix, I have read and heard a number of 
            <br>Filipinos ask the question: “Are we cursed by God” or being punished?

            <br><br>
            <br>Who can blame people for having “calamity fatigue,” how can we blame others for being despondent considering 
            <br>our latest discovery of how “public servants” and “Honorable” members of Congress have been stealing us blind.

            <br><br>
            <br>Depending on whose version you read, there is some debate on whether or not the late President Manuel L. Quezon 
            <br>did in fact declare “I would rather have a government run like hell by Filipinos than a government run like heaven 
            <br>by foreigners.”

            <br><br>
            <br>Some think that President Quezon’s declaration became an unintentional curse on the Philippines that has led to a 
            <br>chain of hell-like administrations. Interestingly, the succeeding presidents are not known for making definitive 
            <br>positive declarations for the future of the country.

            <br><br>
            <br>I remember Ferdinand Marcos Sr. declaring “This country can be great again.” which was an iffy kind of statement, 
            <br>while Manong Eddie Ramos was fond of saying “Kaya Natin Ito” or “We can do this” which was also sort of “iffy.” 
            <br>Since then, all the other presidents have said forgettable lines.

            <br><br>
            <br>To those initiated in subject of curses, the matter they say can be both highly complex as well as incredibly simple. 
            <br>Historically and in terms of religion, the clearest reference in the Bible for curses is found in the book of 
            <br>Deuteronomy Chapter 28 verses 1 to 68.

            <br><br>
            <br>The book starts out with a covenant of blessings for God’s people and believers if they follow his commands and are obedient. 
            <br>They will all be blessed physically, spiritually and materially, etc.

            <br><br>
            <br>“If you fully obey the Lord your God and carefully follow all his commands…The Lord your God will set you high above all 
            <br>the nations of the earth. All these blessings will come upon you and accompany you if you obey the Lord your God….”

            <br><br>
            <br>But if they disobey wickedly, the worst possible things will happen to them beyond material deprivation. They will experience 
            <br>hunger, drought, persecution, occupation, disease and destruction.

            <br><br>
            <br>As I think back in Philippine history, we were a deeply religious nation proudly claiming to be the only Christian or 
            <br>Catholic nation in the southeast Asian region. I remember then that at 6 p.m. church bells would ring for the praying 
            <br>of the “Angelus”
