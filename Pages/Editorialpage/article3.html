            <br>Infrastructure scams begin with Malacañang’s annual budgeting. Kickbacks are inserted in funding proposals of 
            <br>various agencies.

            <br><br>
            <br>Foremost are Departments of Public Works, Education, Health, Agriculture and the 
            <br>Interior and Local Government.

            <br><br>
            <br>Filipinos ask the question: “Are we cursed by God” or being punished?

            <br><br>
            <br>More payoffs are added during separate Senate and House committee hearings. Still more at the closed-door 
            <br>bicameral conference, which finalizes the General Appropriations Acts for presidential signing.

            <br><br>
            <br>That’s the interim report of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure. Filipinos have long known it.

            <br><br>
            <br>But there’s a hole in ICI’s findings. It blames only resigned congressman Zaldy Co of Ako Bicol party-list.

            <br><br>
            <br>It must dig deeper. One man alone, even if chairman of the House committee on appropriations, can’t be 
            <br>responsible for P1.7-trillion overpriced flood works.

            <br><br>
            <br>To begin with, the scandal spans two administrations. It began under Rody Duterte, 2016-2022, followed by 
            <br>Bongbong Marcos, 2022 to present.

            <br><br>
            <br>Co was appropriations boss from July 2022 to January 2025. Before him there were Davao City Rep Isidro Ungab, 
            <br>July 2016-February 2020, and ACT-CIS party’s Eric Yap, March 2020-July 2022.

            <br><br>
            <br>No one becomes head of that almighty committee unless handpicked by the Speaker. There’s also the counterpart 
            <br>committee head at the Senate.

            <br><br>
            <br>Also, no allocation can be inserted in a department’s budget without the secretary’s nod. Two of them, in fact, 
            <br>are now squealing – but only on Co.
