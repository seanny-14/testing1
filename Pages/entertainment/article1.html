            <br>Albie Casiño shared that his becoming a new dad prompted him to call out Slater Young, who is currently in 
            <br>the public eye for his controversial The Rise at Monterrazas project. 
            
            <br><br>
            <br>Casiño told the members of the press on Thursday, Nov. 13, in Quezon City during the story conference of his 
            <br>upcoming film “Andoy” that the reason he has become more political now is because of his son and his current 
            <br>non-showbiz partner. 

            <br><br>
            <br>“I guess we can thank my baby mama. Kasi parang lagi niyang sinasabi sa akin that you’re so vocal about US politics, 
            <br>never about your own. Now I have a son, so I guess I’m more political now. Dati naman, wala naman akong pakialam 
            <br>kung ano mangyayari sa iba. But now that I have a son, I want to leave a better future for him,” he said.

            <br><br>
            <br>Casiño earlier called out Young on social media for being silent amid renewed backlash over the latter’s 
            <br>controversial hillside development, which some speculated contributed to the recent flooding in Cebu. 

            <br><br>
            <br>The actor said that although he doesn’t know Young personally, that would not stop him from calling him out 
            <br>publicly, especially after the celebrity engineer previously claimed that the project would not be “harmful” 
            <br>to the environment. 

            <br><br>
            <br>“Nung nagsimula ‘yung project, parang maraming siyang sinasabi na hindi daw mangyayari, pero nangyari, so I 
            <br>just wanna know… And wala masyadong nag-uusap about it, kasi I guess friend nila yung asawa (Kryz Uy), that’s 
            <br>selective outrage,” he said.


            <br><br>
            <br>The actor explained that he was “heartbroken” seeing the videos of the flood victims, specifically the clip 
            <br>where a crying child told his mother that they have lost everything while they were on the roof of their house 
            <br>because of the floodwaters.

            <br><br>
            <br>“It’s just sad the state of what’s going on now. Like I said, before ‘yung talagang tingin ko sa buhay is wala 
            <br>naman akong pakialam kung ano mangyayari sa politics kasi hindi naman mag-iiba ‘yung buhay ko doon,” he said.
 
            <br><br>
            <br>“But I guess when I had a son, I became more empathetic to other people. Yung mga videos lang na lumalabas, 
            <br>like the video of them on the roof, tas yung bata, sabi, Mommy, we lost everything, diba, parang… It breaks your 
            <br>heart,” he continued. 

            <br><br>
            <br>Casiño further urged Young to speak up and address the backlash, stating, “As a man, maybe speak up, diba? 
            <br>Say something. Condolences to the families, to the people who lost loved ones. Kahit ‘yun na lang.”

            <br><br>
            <br>The 32-year-old actor, who also previously called out Zaldy Co in relation to the anomalous flood control projects 
            <br>and the rampant corruption in the Philippines, said that his Christmas wish is for corrupt individuals to be finally 
            <br>held accountable.

            <br><br>
            <br>“I don’t wish death on anybody because there’s no coming back from death. Pero let’s hold them accountable. 
            <br>Doon na lang,” he said.
