        <p class="p4">MANILA, Philippines – The International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant ordering the arrest of Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa 
            <br>has yet to be made public, but the senator already wants the Supreme Court (SC) to prevent it from being implemented.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p class="p5">Dela Rosa — with ICC-detained former president Rodrigo Duterte as a co-petitioner — filed a petition for 
            <br>certiorari and prohibition with the SC to request the High Court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) 
            <br>against his reported impending arrest.</p>

        <p class="p6">In the petition filed on Thursday, November 13, the former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief – who was the 
            <br>first to implement Duterte’s drug war that killed nearly 30,000, according to human rights groups — wants the Marcos government to:</p>
        
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li>Avoid enforcing the ICC warrant, red notice, or surrender request against Dela Rosa</li>
            <li>Avoid extending any form of assistance to ICC witnesses</li>
            <li>Refrain from transmitting any ICC-related communication correspondence pending final resolution of the case</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        <p class="p7">The PNP chief-turned-lawmaker played a vital role in the drug war as he is considered its “architect.”  Between 
            <br>July 2016 to October 2018, covering most of Dela Rosa’s time as PNP chief, at least 4,999 had died, according to 
            <br>Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency’s data.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="p8">"On November 8, former Department of Justice (DOJ) and now Ombudsman Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla 
            <br>said the ICC has already issued a warrant of arrest against Dela Rosa over his involvement in the war on drugs.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="p9">
            <br>In a separate petition with the SC, Dela Rosa’s camp also wants to compel Remulla to submit to the Court the supposed warrant he’s referring to. 

            <br><br>
            <br>“Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that this Honorable Court order Respondent Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla 
            <br>to immediately submit a copy of the alleged ICC warrant he claims to possess on his mobile phone and direct him to 
            <br>file a sworn explanation stating how he obtained the alleged document, from whom, when, and under what authority,” Dela Rosa’s petition read.

            <br><br>
            <br>Remulla, during a press briefing with reporters on November 10, reiterated that there’s already a warrant against Dela Rosa.

            <br><br>
            <br>“I have the warrant on my phone. But it’s not an official copy. [They] will go to the proper channels to implement it,” the Ombudsman said.

            <br><br>
            <br>ICC-accredited lawyer Kristina Conti explained that there had been an amendment to ICC rules, requiring that all warrant 
            <br>requests should be filed by the prosecutor as “secret.”

            <br><br>
            <br>“What this means is that, whether a warrant has indeed been issued or is still to be issued, it is most likely not 
            <br>intended to be made known to the public — until of course a suspect has been brought to the court,” Conti said. “Considerations 
            <br>for publicizing or not publicizing a warrant include whether this could interrupt criminal conduct, deter the commission of 
            <br>other crimes, or maximize opportunities for arrest.”

            <br><br>
            <br>Extradition is the “removal of an accused from the Philippines with the object of placing him at the disposal of 
            <br>foreign authorities to enable the requesting state or government to hold him in connection with any criminal investigation 
            <br>directed against him or the execution of a penalty imposed on him under the penal or criminal law of the 
            <br>requesting state or government.”

            <br><br>
            <br>“Under Rule 2, Section 4 (of the newly approved rules), the Court must first make a judicial determination of 
            <br>probable cause before any warrant of arrest may issue for extradition or surrender. Rule 2, Section 158 further 
            <br>provides that no surrender or turnover shall take place unless there is final judgment by the Court,” Dela Rosa argued.

            <br><br>
            <br>DOJ officials, on November 11, said the Philippines can surrender Dela Rosa to The Hague, Netherlands, 
            <br>if not through extradition. The officials said surrender is the faster route and under Republic Act No. 9851 or 
            <br>the Philippine Act on Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide, and Other Crimes Against Humanity, 
            <br>the country can extradite or surrender a person wanted by an international court.

            <br><br>
            <br>For some lawyers like international law expert Ross Tugade, the newly approved extradition rules do not apply to Dela Rosa’s case.

            <br><br>
            <br>“The SC rules, and extradition as a process in general, strictly refers to another state requesting the presence of a person in their 
            <br>jurisdiction to answer for crimes. The ICC is not a state; it is a treaty-established court,” Tugade told Rappler.
