        <p class="p5">The Commission on Audit (COA) on Wednesday found P344 million worth of flood control projects in 
        <br>Bulacan to be either non-existent or constructed at mismatched sites.
        <br><br>
        <br>In its fraud audit report submitted to the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI), state auditors said the 
        <br>four flood control projects implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) 
        <br>Bulacan First District Engineering Office (DEO) were marred by fraud, falsification, and lack of accountability.
        <br>The projects include:
        </p>
        <br><br>    
            <ul class="ul1">
                <li>Riverbank protection structure at Barangay San Roque (Purok 2), Baliuag, Bulacan by SYMS Construction 
                <br>Trading — P74 million</li>
                <li>Riverbank protection structure at Barangay San Roque, Baliuag, Bulacan, spanning 229.20 linear meters by 
                <br>M3 Konstract Corporation — P96.5 million</li>
                <li>Riverbank protection structure at Balagtas River, Barangay Santol, Balagtas, Bulacan, spanning 228.80 linear 
                <br>meters by Elite General Contractor & Development Corporation — P96.5 million</li>
                <li>Riverbank protection structure at Barangay Caingin, Malolos City, Bulacan, spanning 203.20 linear meters by 
                <br>Wawao Builders — P77.2 million</li>
            </ul>

        <br><br>
        <p class="p6">“COA's inspection of these four projects revealed systemic irregularities by the DPWH-Bulacan 1st DEO and contractors,” 
        <br>the COA said.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p class="p7">
        <br>“DPWH-Bulacan 1st DEO representatives directed COA to sites different from the approved project locations. In some 
        <br>instances, no explanation or written justification for the change was provided,” it added.

        <br><br>
        <br>State auditors also noted that several approved locations already had existing structures that could not be attributed to the new projects.

        <br><br>
        <br>“One case involved an existing riverbank structure evident just 22 days after the project was awarded, and another site contained an 
        <br>existing structure with defects and cracks,” the COA said.

        <br><br>
        <br>“In one case, a project tagged as 100% complete had no flood control structure visible at the pinpointed location,” it added.

        <br><br>
        <br>COA auditors said the DPWH-Bulacan 1st DEO failed to provide critical supporting documents necessary to validate the projects. 
        <br>Specifically, the office did not submit key documents for the SYMS Construction Trading project.

        <br><br>
        <br>“The DPWH-Bulacan 1st DEO had previously been issued a notice of disallowance by the COA Audit Team for non-submission of paid 
        <br>disbursement vouchers and corresponding supporting documents related to the projects,” COA said.

        <br><br>
        <br>According to COA, the P74 million project by SYMS Construction Trading in Baliuag was non-existent, while the P96.5 million project 
        <br>by M3 Konstract Corporation already showed multiple defects and cracks.

        <br><br>
        <br>The Elite General Contractor & Development Corporation’s P96.5 million project in Balagtas was found split into two sections, contrary 
        <br>to the approved plan requiring a single continuous structure.

        <br><br>
        <br>Meanwhile, the P77 million Malolos project by Wawao Builders spanned only 55 meters at the approved location--far shorter than the 
        <br>approved 148.8 meters.

        <br><br>
        <br>When COA inspectors were directed to another location by the DPWH, they found no flood control structure, despite the project being 
        <br>marked as 100% complete.

        <br><br>
        <br>“The individuals involved may face charges for graft and corruption under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as well as for malversation 
        <br>and falsification of documents under the Revised Penal Code. Violations of COA Circular No. 2009-001 are also noted,” the COA said.

        <br><br>
        <br>Those found liable include former DPWH officials, engineers, and representatives of the construction companies:
