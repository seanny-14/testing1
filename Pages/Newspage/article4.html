            <br>MANILA — Several individuals accused of corruption in flood control cases could be arrested and jailed “before Christmas”, 
            <br>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Thursday.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p class="p5">
            <br>Authorities are looking to file criminal and administrative cases against 37 individuals, including lawmakers, 
            <br>contractors and other government officials, Marcos told reporters in a Malacañang press conference.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Bago mag-Pasko marami dito sa napangalanan dito, palagay ko matatapos na ang kaso nila, buo na yung kaso nila,” 
            <br>he said.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Makukulong na sila, wala silang Merry Christmas,” he said.

            <br><br>
            <br>The government has no definite timeline on when it would wrap up investigations and the filing of cases 
            <br>against those involved in the flood control project scandal, the President said.

        <p class="p6">
            <br>“Nakakatiyak ako na marami pa tayong mababawi dito so patuloy naming gagawin yun,” he said.

            <br><br>
            <br>So far, the Malacañang estimated that it could recoup at least P18.16 billion through restitution of several assets.

            <br><br>
            <br>The government is looking at recovering the allegedly ill-gotten funds through the following: 
        </p>
        
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li>P6.3 billion from the freezing of several bank accounts, real properties, vehicles, other assets</li>
            <li>P3 billion to P5 billion in penalties from 12 bid-rigging cases</li>
            <li>P8.86 billion in tax evasion cases against nearly 100 contractors, DPWH and COA officials</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p class="p7">
            <br>“Babantayan natin nang husto every step of the way. Bawat hakbang sa prosesong ito ay babantayan nating mabuti,” the President said. 

            <br><br>
            <br>“Lahat naman tayo ay nais nating makamtan kaagad ang hustisya. Kung may aral tayong natutunan sa nakaraan ay maging mas mabusisi tayo 
            <br>at tumagal ng kaunti kaysa magkamali,” he said.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Ang ayaw namin ay yung mga kasabwat dito ay makakalusot because of a legal technicality… Titiyakin namin na kapag kami ay nagsampa ng kaso, 
            <br>yang kaso na yan ay matibay hanggang dulo…. at kung huhusgahan sila ng korte ay makukulong sila.”

            <br><br>
            <br>Meanwhile, Sen. Imee Marcos was incredulous at  the pronouncement of her brother, the President, that there was no evidence to pin down 
            <br>Romualdez in the flood control scandal.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Kamuntik na akong nalaglag sa upuan," Marcos told reporters.

            <br><br>
            <br>Marcos said she received information that congressmen testifying before the Blue Ribbon Committee on Friday would clear Romualdez.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Ang latest chika, ang magaganap bukas dyan sa Blue Ribbon ay yung mga congressman pupunta doon. May script na daw sila. 
            <br>At yun nga, liliwanagin na walang kinalaman si Martin Romualdez,” the senator said.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="p7">
            <br>"Di, may Merry Christmas. Kasi, diba, sabi niya na si dating speaker Martin ay hindi kakasuhan. Pero so far, wala. So, Merry Christmas pa rin,” she added.

            <br><br>
            <br>Sen. Marcos added that she had disowned her cousin.

            <br><br>
            <br>"Tiniwalag ko na yun,” she said of Romualdez.

            <br><br>
            <br>She added that former Congressman Zaldy Co mght join the Senate hearing on Friday via Zoom.  But Blue Ribbon Committee chairperson and Senate President Pro 
            <br>Tempore Panfilo Lacson said Co was not invited.

            <br><br>
            <br>“I didn’t push through with the initial plan to invite him via Zoom. On second thought, the hearing might afford him a platform to say anything he wants 
            <br>even with no probative value and worse for propaganda purposes only without any accountability for at least possible contempt citation,” he said.    

            <br><br>
            <br>Lacson declined to comment on Sen. Marcos’ other remarks.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="p7">
            <br>"More than Sen Imee’s crystal ball, my bigger concern is how to recover my normal voice in time for tomorrow’s BRC hearing or this afternoon’s budget 
            <br>plenary debates which I have intended to interpellate. I’ve  lost my voice since yesterday after drinking ice cold water with a sore throat last Tuesday night. 
            <br>I’m under medication, while drinking salabat, gurgling water with rock salt, etc. I hope it gets better, to speak audibly at least,” he said.

            <br><br>
            <br>Meanwhile, at least two House leaders agreed with the President’s statement that there was no sufficient evidence yet against Romualdez.

            <br><br>
            <br>House Deputy Speaker Ronaldo Puno said Romualdez was not part of the bicameral conference committee, accused of making billions of pesos in insertions 
            <br>in the proposed 2025 national budget for flood control and other infrastructure projects.

            <br><br>
            <br>Puno added that the testimony of Orly Guteza, who supposedly delivered suitcases of cash to the residence of Romualdez and Co was not corroborated. 
            <br>The signature in Guteza’s affidavit also turned out to be forged.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Yung Guteza nga, nag-uumpisa pa lang, mayroon nang palsipikado, kasi ‘yung kanyang notarization, palsipikado na. Tapos noong sa salaysay niya, sabi niya, 
            <br>may dalawang kasama ako, dineny naman noong dalawa. Tapos sabi niya, hinatid ko sa bahay ni dating Speaker ito dito sa Forbes. E hindi naman nakatira si Speaker 
            <br>at that time doon, dahil nasa ibang bahay siya dahil nire-repair itong isang bahay na ito. So, kumbaga, ano’ng ebidensya laban kay Speaker ngayon? Wala naman 
            <br>nakakapagsabi ng kahit ano eh,” Puno said.

            <br><br>
            <br>House Deputy Speaker Paolo Ortega V said the ICI records showed “no paper trail, no transaction, and no testimony” linking Romualdez to any questionable project.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Former Speaker Romualdez has already faced the ICI under oath. He submitted documents, answered every question, and made himself fully accountable. The agencies 
            <br>handling the review have full access to the records, and none points to his involvement,” Ortega said in a statement.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Public service demands fairness. We cannot destroy reputations based on innuendo. We owe the public a process that is sober, factual, and rooted in due 
            <br>process,” he added.

            <br><br>
            <br>House Committee on Human Rights Chairperson Bienvenido Abante Jr. shared this sentiment.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Up to now, there is no document, no signature, no transaction, and no testimony directly pointing to former Speaker Romualdez. The ICI has access to all 
            <br>implementing agencies. If anything existed, it would have surfaced by now,” he said.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Speculation is easy. Accountability requires facts. The President’s message was simple and correct: bring the evidence, and the government will act. Without it, 
            <br>there is no case,” Abante added.

            <br><br>
            <br>Other crimes, or maximize opportunities for arrest.”

            <br><br>
            <br>But ACT Teachers party-list Rep. Antonio Tinio insists, Romualdez should be held accountable for the questionable budget insertions as former House leader, along 
            <br>with the former Senate President, and the President, who signed the budget.

            <br><br>
            <br>“Ang insertions at pag-apruba sa flood control ay ginawa ng House, ng Senate at maging ng Malacanang. So ang mga pinuno ng lahat ng ‘yan, so ‘yung Senate President, 
            <br>‘yung House Speaker, at saka ‘yung Presidente mismo, may pananagutan ‘yun,” Tinio said. 

            <br><br>
            <br>“Bilang Speaker, siyempre may papel, mahalagang papel sa pagpasa ng budget na ngayon ay punong-puno ng corruption. So therefore, dapat humarap at managot,” he said.
