        <p class="p5">Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Wednesday said the copy of the alleged International 
        <br>Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant against Senator Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa reportedly obtained by 
        <br>Ombudsman Jesus Crispin "Boying" Remulla was from a "third source."</p>

        <p class="p6">"Sa telepono lang kami nagkausap. Ang sinabi niya sa akin, nakuha niya ang electronic copy from a third source. 
        <br>So, hindi po galing sa ICC," Jonvic told Dobol B TV in an interview. 
        
        <p class="p7">(We talked on the phone. He told me he got the electronic copy from a third source. So, it's not from the ICC.)</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="p8">"But in form and in function, mukha siyang official. But as far as we are concerned kasi, basta nasa security aparatus ka, 
            <br>dapat actionable document. Dapat dumating talaga," added Jonvic, the Ombudsman's brother. 
            <br>

            <br>(But in form and in function, it looks official. But as far as we are concerned, when you're in security apparatus, 
            <br>you need an actionable document. The official copy should be sent.)

            <br>He refused to comment when asked how the Philippine National Police (PNP) will implement a possible ICC arrest warrant against 
            <br>Dela Rosa. He said authorities would wait first for an  official copy of the order. 
            
            <br><br>
            <br>On November 8, Ombudsman Remulla said the ICC has issued a warrant of arrest against Dela Rosa. The DILG earlier said that no red notice from 
            <br>ICC has been received yet by the Center for Transnational Crime.

            <br><br>
            <br>ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah told GMA Integrated News that "ICC news can be found only on ICC official communications channels and press releases, 
            <br>and you can see that we still have only one case currently, the one against Mr. Duterte."

            <br><br>
            <br>On Tuesday, the Ombudsman said he has an unofficial copy of the arrest warrant against Dela Rosa. 

            <br><br>
            <br>Dela Rosa's camp previously said it has yet to secure official information that the ICC has indeed issued a warrant against him. 
            <br>The senator's counsel, Atty. Israelito Torreon, also said they have been made aware of circulating reports.
            
            <br><br>
            <br>Based on government records, around 6,200 drug suspects were killed during the Duterte administration's anti-drug operations. 
            <br>Human rights organizations, however, say that the number may reach 30,000 due to the unreported related slays.

            <br><br>
            <br>Dela Rosa was the chief of the Philippine National Police when the war on drugs was implemented under the Duterte administration.
