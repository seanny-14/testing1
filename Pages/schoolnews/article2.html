        <br>Manila Central University (MCU), through its College of Nursing, hosted international delegates from STIKes 
        <br>Budi Luhur Cimahi and Kemenkes Poltekkes Bengkulu, Indonesia, on October 13–14, 2025, as part of its continuing 
        <br>efforts to promote cross-border academic cooperation and global nursing education.

        <br><br>
        <br>The two-day event included a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signing between MCU and Kemenkes Poltekkes Bengkulu, 
        <br>formalizing a partnership focused on collaborative initiatives in nursing education, student and faculty exchange, 
        <br>and community engagement programs.

        <br><br>
        <br>As part of their visit, international students from both institutions participated in a campus tour and a College of 
        <br>Nursing immersion, where they experienced hands-on learning sessions and observed the university’s academic facilities 
        <br>and healthcare training environments. 

        <br><br>
        <br>The visit fostered meaningful exchanges between MCU faculty and the Indonesian delegates, highlighting shared goals in 
        <br>promoting academic excellence, healthcare innovation, and cultural understanding.

        <br><br>
        <br>This initiative reflects MCU’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 4 – Quality Education and SDG 17 
        <br>– Partnerships for the Goals, emphasizing its dedication to creating global linkages that empower future healthcare professionals.

        <br><br>
        <br>Through partnerships like these, MCU continues to strengthen its global footprint in nursing education, 
        <br>cultivating collaboration and knowledge-sharing that transcend borders. 🌍
