        <br>In line with its advocacy for environmental stewardship, Manila Central University (MCU) successfully conducted its Tree 
        <br>Growing Activity on October 17, 2025, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon. 

        <br><br>
        <br>The activity, organized in partnership with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), brought together 
        <br>MCU employees in a shared effort to promote environmental awareness, sustainability, and community responsibility. 
        <br>Participants took part in planting and nurturing trees—symbolizing the university’s collective dedication to restoring 
        <br>ecosystems and mitigating the effects of climate change.

        <br><br>
        <br>Beyond its environmental purpose, the initiative also encouraged teamwork and unity among MCU employees, aligning with the 
        <br>university’s mission to nurture socially responsible citizens who actively contribute to the well-being of society and the planet.

        <br><br>
        <br>This activity supports Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 13 – Climate Action, SDG 15 – Life on Land, and SDG 17 – 
        <br>Partnerships for the Goals, reinforcing MCU’s ongoing commitment to environmental protection and cross-sectoral 
        <br>collaboration.

        <br><br>
        <br>Through continued efforts like this, MCU reaffirms its pledge to “grow greener together”—planting not only trees but 
        <br>also the seeds of awareness, responsibility, and hope for a sustainable future.
